        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> Change is something that appeals to me. I welcome the creative work and appreciate the exposure to new ideas. I have a high level of curiosity, and I am open to new experiences. I am usually diligent and disciplined, and I strive to deliver quality work in most situation.<br><br>I plan activities and like an ordered, tidy environment. Decisions are usually considered carefully and thoroughly. I am being likely to enjoy being the centre of attention, and I am happier being with people I know and in small groups. <br><br>I often prefer my own company and can sometimes feel uncomfortable if forced to spend time with lots of people for extended period. I sometimes prefer to listen rather than talk. <br><br>I am usually patient and tolerated. I probably hold back from judging people until their point of view has been heard and understood. Others would describe me as cooperative and even-tempered. <br><br>I have natural energy and enthusiasm for what I do. People mostly enjoy being with me and I enjoy the company of others. I get personal gratification from being sought after by others. I am trusted by those who know me to always do the right thing and put the needs of others before my own. I am modest about my achievements and feel that rewards come to those who earn them rather than based on any entitlement.

        <h1>My research paper</h1>
        <p>My research about the natural disasters in Myanmar focused mainly on Yangon which is the biggest and the most commercial city. I mentioned how people withstand disasters and how the government, non-governmental organizations, and many charity organizations support the affected areas and localities. Preparing to withstand natural disasters in advance is much better before the localities encountered the disasters. In my research, I discussed some giant disasters, flooding, and earthquakes that happened in Myanmar in the last decade. I described how people in Yangon withstand the disasters and how people survive in the locations susceptible to natural disasters.</p>
