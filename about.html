        <h1>My research paper</h1>
        <p>My research about the natural disasters in Myanmar focused mainly on Yangon which is the biggest and the most commercial city. I mentioned how people withstand disasters and how the government, non-governmental organizations, and many charity organizations support the affected areas and localities. Preparing to withstand natural disasters in advance is much better before the localities encountered the disasters. In my research, I discussed some giant disasters, flooding, and earthquakes that happened in Myanmar in the last decade. I described how people in Yangon withstand the disasters and how people survive in the locations susceptible to natural disasters.</p>
